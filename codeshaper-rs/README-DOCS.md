# Code Shaper

This is a tool that makes using Regex in 
Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) easier, by visiting the AST
nodes, so you can perform any type of regex manipulation.

It allows you to search/match AST locations and then
add/replace/remove/build new text for them, or for
other nodes, so that your regex application doesn't
end up in the bin after you used it and also status
usable after a long time if necessary it in the future
